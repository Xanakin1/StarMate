  <h1>Starmate Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>Welcome to Starmate! By accessing our website and purchasing one of our personalized star maps, you agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Starmate creates customized digital star maps based on a meaningful date and location you provide — such as an anniversary, first date, engagement night, or any romantic moment.</p>

  <h2>2. Payment and Delivery</h2>
  <p>All payments are securely processed through Stripe. After your purchase is completed, your personalized star map will be generated and delivered to the email address you provided, typically within a few minutes.</p>

  <h2>3. Digital Product Policy</h2>
  <p>Because each map is custom-created for a specific couple, <strong>all sales are final</strong>. If there is an issue with your file (missing text, incorrect details, formatting errors, etc.), please contact us and we will gladly correct it.</p>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content on the Starmate website — including star maps, graphics, text, and layout — is the property of Starmate. You may not copy, distribute, or resell any part of our designs without written permission.</p>

  <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>You agree to provide accurate information for generating your star map. You also agree not to misuse the Starmate website for unlawful or harmful purposes.</p>

  <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>We aim to provide accurate astronomical representations using publicly available celestial data, but we do not guarantee absolute astronomical precision.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>Starmate is not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of our website or digital products.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, USA.</p>
